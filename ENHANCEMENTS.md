# Enhancement Ideas

## Implemented
- Web UI dialog preview with inline print feedback.
- In-memory rendering toggle: `RETAIN_TICKET_FILES` to avoid disk writes.
- Task history pane with one-click reprint.

## Proposed / Backlog
- Minimal auth (shared secret or Cloudflare Access header check).
- Health/status endpoint and UI banner for printer reachability.
- Alternate ticket themes (compact vs bold) selectable via UI/env.
